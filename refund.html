                            <h2>2. Transactions involving Crypto Currency (i.e. BitCoin, Litecoin)</h2>
                            <p>Refunds are not possible for all transactions where customer is purchasing Crypto
                                Currency. However, in case customer changed his mind and would like to return purchased
                                Crypto Currency {site_domain}&nbsp;would be able to buy it back based on current market
                                rate minus the service fee for the transaction. In other words, customer can exchange
                                purchased Crypto Currency (i.e. BitCoin) for any existing Digital Currency (i.e. PayPal)
                                or Payment Method (i.e. Credit Card payment or Bank Transfer).</p>
                            <p>The reason for such policy is the fact that price of Crypto Currency changes constantly
                                thus the value of purchased Crypto Currency on the moment of refund will be different.&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>3. Transactions NOT involving Crypto Currency (i.e. BitCoin, Litecoin)</h2>
                            <p>Refunds are possible during 30 days from the exchange operation. {site_domain}&nbsp;will
                                charge customer the one time refund fee of 5% of the transacted amount plus any
                                additional service fees incurred by sending customer via original payment method.</p>
                            <p>For example if customer have purchased Digital Currency via Money Gram money transfers
                                and would like to get a refund he would have to send the purchased digital currency back
                                in full amount of the refunded transaction, {site_domain}&nbsp;in return would send money
                                back via Money Gram deducting the tranfer fee's, as result customer would get his
                                original payment less 5% and less Money Gram transfer fees.</p>
