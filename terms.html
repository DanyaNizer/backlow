                            <p>The Cryptocurrency is involved in significant amount of risk. Prices can fluctuate on any
                                given day. Because of such price fluctuations, you may gain or lose value of your assets
                                at any given moment. Any currency may be subject to large swings in value and may even
                                become absolutely worthless. There is always an inherent risk that losses will occur as

                                issue more currency.
                                Cryptocurrency is an autonomous and mostly unregulated worldwide payment system. </p>
